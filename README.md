# JoeScan Pinchot .NET API
The JoeScan Pinchot .NET API is the .NET interface to JoeScan JS-50
scan heads. This API allows users to develop software to run on a desktop
computer and control scan heads that are connected to the same network.
If writing software to control classic JoeScan products such as the JS-20 or
JS-25, please download the supporting software
[here](http://help.joescan.com/display/ds/downloads).
Note that this is the open source release of the Joescan Pinchot API and will
need to be manually built and compiled by the end user. The official
precompiled version of this API is available as a NuGet package at nuget.org.
Alternatively DLL's can be found [here](http://api.joescan.com/release).

## Build Dependencies
In order to build the API and software examples in Windows 10, the following
tools should be installed.

* Visual Studio 2019 with the .NET Framework 4.7.2 and .NET Core development
  tools (".NET desktop development" workload in Visual Studio Installer).

## Support
For direct support for the JoeScan Pinchot API, please reach out to your
JoeScan company representative and we will provide assistance as soon as
possible. The Github page for this project is also monitored by developers
within JoeScan and can be used to post questions or issues.
