# JoeScan Pinchot .NET API
The JoeScan Pinchot .NET API is the interface to JoeScan JS-50
scan heads. This API allows users to develop software to run on a desktop
computer and control scan heads that are connected to the same network.
Please see the [Developer Portal](https://api.joescan.com/) for downloads,
software references, and system documentation.

The easiest way to start using the Pinchot API in your project is by installing the
[NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JoeScan.Pinchot) that is provided
with every release. Search "pinchot" in Visual Studio's NuGet Package Manager
window to quickly install the Pinchot API into your runtime.
